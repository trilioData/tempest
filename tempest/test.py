        Subclasses verify in here all conditions that might prevent the
        execution of the entire test class. Skipping here prevents any other
        class fixture from being executed i.e. no credentials or other
        resource allocation will happen.

        Tests defined in the test class will no longer appear in test results.
        The `setUpClass` for the entire test class will be marked as SKIPPED
        instead.

        At this stage no test credentials are available, so skip checks
        should rely on configuration alone. This is deliberate since skips
        based on the result of an API call are discouraged.

        The following checks are implemented in `test.py` already:

        - check that alt credentials are available when requested by the test
        - check that admin credentials are available when requested by the test
        - check that the identity version specified by the test is marked as
          enabled in the configuration

        Overriders of skip_checks must always invoke skip_check on `super`
        first.

        """Allocate credentials and create the client managers from them.

        `setup_credentials` looks for the content of the `credentials`
        attribute in the test class. If the value is a non-empty collection,
        a credentials provider is setup, and credentials are provisioned or
        allocated based on the content of the collection. Every set of
        credentials is associated to an object of type `cls.client_manager`.
        The client manager is accessible by tests via class attribute
        `os_[type]`:

        Valid values in `credentials` are:

        - 'primary':
            A normal user is provisioned.
            It can be used only once. Multiple entries will be ignored.
            Clients are available at os_primary.
        - 'alt':
            A normal user other than 'primary' is provisioned.
            It can be used only once. Multiple entries will be ignored.
            Clients are available at os_alt.
        - 'admin':
            An admin user is provisioned.
            It can be used only once. Multiple entries will be ignored.
            Clients are available at os_admin.
        - A list in the format ['any_label', 'role1', ... , 'roleN']:
            A client with roles <list>[1:] is provisioned.
            It can be used multiple times, with unique labels.
            Clients are available at os_roles_<list>[0].

        By default network resources are allocated (in case of dynamic
        credentials). Tests that do not need network or that require a
        custom network setup must specify which network resources shall
        be provisioned using the `set_network_resources()` method (note
        that it must be invoked before the `setup_credentials` is
        invoked on super).

        Example::

        `setup_clients` is invoked after the credential provisioning step.
        Client manager objects are available to tests already. The purpose
        of this helper is to setup shortcuts to specific clients that are
        useful for the tests implemented in the test class.

        Its purpose is mostly for code readability, however it should be used
        carefully to avoid doing exactly the opposite, i.e. making the code
        unreadable and hard to debug. If aliases are defined in a super class
        it won't be obvious what they refer to, so it's good practice to define
        all aliases used in the class. Aliases are meant to be shortcuts to
        be used in tests, not shortcuts to avoid helper method attributes.
        If an helper method starts relying on a client alias and a subclass
        overrides that alias, it will become rather difficult to understand
        what the helper method actually does.

        `resource_setup` is invoked once all credentials (and related network
        resources have been provisioned and after client aliases - if any -
        have been defined.

        The use case for `resource_setup` is test optimization: provisioning
        of project-specific "expensive" resources that are not dirtied by tests
        and can thus safely be re-used by multiple tests.

        System wide resources shared by all tests could instead be provisioned
        only once, before the test run.

        Resources provisioned here must be cleaned up during
        `resource_cleanup`. This is best achieved by scheduling a cleanup via
        `addClassResourceCleanup`.

        Some test resources have an asynchronous delete process. It's best
        practice for them to schedule a wait for delete via
        `addClassResourceCleanup` to avoid having resources in process of
        deletion when we reach the credentials cleanup step.

                cls.shared_server = servers.create_server()
                # Create server 2. If something goes wrong we schedule cleanup
