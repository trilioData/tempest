           apt-get install python3-workloadmgrclient -y
           ```

         - Run below script to create virtual environment:
           ```
           python3 tools/install_venv.py
            ```
    - Ubuntu 20.04

           cat > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/trilio.list <<-EOF
           deb [trusted=yes] https://apt.fury.io/triliodata-4-1/ /
           EOF
           apt-get update
           apt-get install python3-workloadmgrclient -y
           ```

         - Run below script to create virtual environment:
           ```
           python3 tools/install_venv.py
            ```

* Openstack prerequisites:

    - Cloud admin user should be set on the openstack. Using this user, one should be able to list all projects, domains, users on the openstack. 
    - Test user, project and domain should be already available on the openstack. One can choose to use any user, project and domain for running tempest tests.
    - The test user should have admin role on the project and domain.
    - CentOS cloud image should be already uploaded on the openstack. This is needed for File recovery manager related tests (like snapshot mount).
    - Ensure trustee role specified in openstack-setup.conf file is assigned to the test user.
    - Internal and external networks should be already configured and available on the test project.
    - Atleast 2 Floating IPs should be available and allocated to the test project.
    - Atleast one volume type should be defined and available on the openstack.
    - Test image (eg: cirros) should already be available on the openstack.    
    - FRM (CentOS8 or Ubuntu18) image should already be available on the openstack with below properties. By default, we assume CentOS8 is used as FRM.
    	- hw_qemu_guest_agent=yes
    	- tvault_recovery_manager=yes

* Configure tempest:

    - Update the openstack setup details in openstack-setup.conf file 
    - Run the wrapper script fetch_resources.sh
      ```
      ./fetch_resources.sh
      ```
    - Update tempest/tvaultconf.py and provide below:
        - tvault_password = "sample password" â†’ TrilioVault appliance root password
                
* How to run tests:

    - All tempest tests are run on virtual environment.
    - To run a single test:
        - Execute run_tempest.sh file with required script as argument
          ```
          ./run_tempest.sh tempest.api.workloadmgr.workload.test_tvault1033_create_workload
          ```
        - Log file "tempest.log" would be available
    - To run sanity tests, run below:
        ```
        ./sanity-run.sh
        ```
        - Log file will be available in "logs/" directory
    - To run a suite:
        - Update master-run.sh file with required suite details:
            - SUITE_LIST=("tempest.api.workloadmgr.workload") 
        - Now run below:
            ```
            ./master-run.sh 
            ```
        - Log files would be available in "logs/" directory.
     - If a virtual env already exists, tempest uses the existing one for test execution. Else it would prompt the user to create a new virtual env.

* Test Coverage:

    - Licensing tests
    - Workload tests
    - Snapshot tests
    - Restore tests (Note - This needs min. 2 Floating IPs configureed on Openstack)
        - One click restore
        - Selective restore
        - In-place restore
    - File search tests
    - Workload Policy tests
    - Workload Modify
    - Chargeback tests
    - Sanity tests
    - RBAC tests
    - Network restore tests

* NOTES

* Adding the license to triliovault is a mandatory for any succeeding test case. You can add it to triliovault by CLI/UI.
